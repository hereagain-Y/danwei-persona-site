//             My research focuses on applying large language models (LLMs) to statistical genetics, with the aim of building more interpretable and accurate AI systems for disease risk estimation using human genetic data. I'm especially interested in how LLMs can be used to encode individual-level mutation profiles (like SNPs) and uncover meaningful genotype–phenotype patterns. Beyond model performance, I also care deeply about health equity—exploring how disease and financial burdens vary across populations, and developing tools that can support those facing medical and socioeconomic challenges.

//           I come from an interdisciplinary background—earning my master’s degree in Epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University, and my bachelor’s degree in Horticultural Science with a minor in Bioinformatics back in China and Florida. This diverse training has shaped how I approach problems at the intersection of health, data, and computation.

//             Outside of research, I spend most of my free time climbing (bouldering is my therapy), running, and occasionally smashing birdies on the badminton court. I’m always chasing the next dyno or techy slab—and just like in research, I love a good challenge that makes me sweat a little.
